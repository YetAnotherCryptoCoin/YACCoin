# YACCoin
Our attempt to create another cryptocurrency implementation to supplement the already existing ones.<br />

## Seemingly promising data structures
* A `mempool` to hold the local copies of unused transactions (the ones not yet included in the blockchain).
* A `transaction` entity.
* A `block` entity.
* A `transaction verification` entity.
* The `blockchain`.
